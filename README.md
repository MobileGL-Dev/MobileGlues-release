**MobileGlues**, which stands for "(on) Mobile, GL uses ES", is a GL implementation running on top of host OpenGL ES 3.x (best on 3.2, minimum 3.0), with running Minecraft: Java Edition in mind.

# Features

1. Capable of running Minecraft [Sodium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium) mod;

2. Capable of rendering most minecraft shaders with Minecraft [Iris](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris) mod or [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home).

3. Capable of running some Minecraft mods with custom rendering routines, such as [JourneyMap](https://teamjm.github.io/journeymap-docs/latest) and [Create](https://createmod.net).

4. Additional QoL features: optional ANGLE as ES driver, shader caching for fast shaderpack reloads, supports Minecraft GPU% reporting, ...and more!

# Call to Action

Since we are a small team, we cannot own every distinct device and do through tests on them.

If you are interested in this project, please consider contributing to the project by:

Filling out the [mod support matrix](https://github.com/MobileGL-Dev/MobileGlues-release/blob/main/ModSupportMatrix.md) or [shader support matrix](https://github.com/MobileGL-Dev/MobileGlues-release/blob/main/ShaderSupportMatrix.md)!

We need your help to test the compatibility of shaders and mods, and a broad variety of devices!

> [!NOTE]
> How to fill out the table
>
> You may:
>
> - Add a new device to the table, by appending a new row to the table. (You can get device codename from `adb shell getprop ro.product.name`)
> - Add a new item to the table, by appending a new column to the table. (Make sure you have modify all the rows to add the column!)
> - Fill out the table with the compatibility of the item on the device, by marking the cell with
>   - a checkmark (✅) if the item is compatible,
>   - or a cross (❌) if the item is fully not compatible (and file an issue/link to the issue).
>   - If the item is not tested (not included in your modpack/you do not install this mod), mark the cell with a question mark (?).
>   - a asterisk (\*️⃣) if the item is working, but have missing features and/or have graphical glitches (and file an issue/link to the issue).
> - If applicable, you may want to mention what additional drivers/plugins rather than the one vendor provides, are in use (such as turnip drivers, ANGLE, etc.) in the "Additional Drivers/Plugins in use" column.
> - If applicable, you should add a file named `*device_codename*.md`, to provide additional information, and put the link in the last column.
